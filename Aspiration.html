                <h1> Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche</h1>
                <p>The present Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, Thubten Chökyi Gyamtso, was born in 1961 in
                eastern Bhutan. He was recognized as a tulku by H.H. Sakya Trizin, and received empowerments 
                and teachings from many of the greatest masters of Tibetan Buddhism, including H.H. the 16th
                Karmapa; H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche and Lama Sonam Zangpo (his paternal and maternal 
                grandfathers); Chatral Rinpoche; Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche, Khenpo Appey, and many others. His 
                root guru was Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who began training Rinpoche from the age of 7.
                While still a teenager, Rinpoche built a small retreat center in Ghezing, Sikkim and soon began
                traveling and teaching around the world. In the 1980s, he began the restoration of Dzongsar 
                Monastery in Derge, the responsibility of which he had inherited from his previous incarnation,
                Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö. He established Dzongsar Institute in Bir, India, (now DKCLI in
                Chauntra), which has grown to be one of the most respected institutions for advanced dialectical 
                study. He also oversees two monasteries in Bhutan and has established dharma centres in
                Australia, Europe, North America, and Asia. He has written several books and made award-winning
                films. Rinpoche continuously travels all over the world, practicing and teaching the Dharma.
